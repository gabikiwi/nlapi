The Volkswagen emissions scandal will cost billions and could tarnish the entire German auto industry.
The company had made bold claims about being greener than other automakers, and had a reputation for reliability and quality engineering. Suddenly, the "Made in Germany" branding doesn't look so hot anymore after it apologized for cheating on diesel car emission tests.

"If nobody else has done it, the damage would be limited. If it looks like it's more companies, not just Volkswagen, it would be a major problem for the German car industry, and the German economy overall," said Theo Vermaelen, a finance professor at INSEAD.

Volkswagen (VLKAY) -- which owns other top brands including Porsche, Audi and Lamborghini -- overtook Toyota (TM) as the world's top carmaker by sales in July, but that position is now at risk, say analysts.

Here are seven key facts that show what's at stake:

1. The Volkswagen group accounts for roughly one in 10 vehicles sold globally*.
2. The auto industry is the largest industrial sector in Germany, contributing about 2.7% to gross domestic product.
